# salesGPT
Sales tool for taking notes in hubspot and using them as prompts to Open AI API

Project Description:
What does an active individual contributer on a revenue team need? 
An outreach tool, a tool to track active deals, and an after sales tool (up/cross selling, staying "intouch").

Revenue teams also need a way to communicate customer needs and business requirements into technical documents for delivery teams.
Managers need a way to track their teams performance (call rates, landed appts., messaging AB testing, etc).
I have yet to find a CRM that is able to do this while remaining simple, inexpensive, and effective.

Perhaps having a single CRM that suites a revenue team's needs leads to a break in either being simple, inexpensive, and effective. 

SalesGPT aims to bridge the gap between different sales tools. SalesGPT will live where we all want to be anyway, slack. From slack, SalesGPT will
get informaiton from CRM, schedule emails/tasks in outreach tools, update information from email replys, and be able to communicate to delivery teams
high level business requirments and get a frame work for getting techinical teams up and running.


TODO:
- Slack Integration
- Add drop down to change from "Sales" to "Engineer" persona and vice-versa
- Add "today's tasks" feature:
    - A list of contacts to reach out too and personalized emails attached to each contact (Apollo Integration?)
    - The list of contacts to reach out to will be based on urgency, last time contacted, potential shift in buying state, ect.
- Add being able to update/create notes directly from slack
